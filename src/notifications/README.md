# Notifications Module

## Purpose in Demo

This module demonstrates **injection hell** in the classic NestJS approach. It's intentionally implemented as a **black hole** to show how multiple dependencies can complicate a simple service.

## What This Module Would Do in Production

In a real application, the `NotificationsService` would:

- **Send in-app notifications** to users via WebSocket or push notifications
- **Store notifications** in database for user history
- **Manage notification preferences** and user settings
- **Handle real-time delivery** to connected clients
- **Integrate with push services** like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Apple Push Notifications

## Why It's a Black Hole

This module is **intentionally left empty** because:

1. **Demo Focus**: We want to focus on the Single Action pattern, not notification implementation
2. **Injection Hell**: Shows how many dependencies a monolithic service needs
3. **Complexity**: Demonstrates why Single Action pattern is better
4. **Learning**: Helps understand the problems with traditional approaches

## Methods

All methods in `NotificationsService` are **dummy implementations** that only log to console. They are **not meant to be implemented** - this is by design for the demonstration.

## Integration

This service is injected into the `UsersService` to demonstrate:
- Multiple service dependencies
- Complex constructor injection
- Mixed concerns in a single service
- Why Single Action pattern is needed

## Note

**DO NOT implement these methods** - they are intentionally black holes for demonstration purposes only.
