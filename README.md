## Description

A practical example of the Single Action Controller pattern in NestJS â€” a lightweight architectural approach where each controller and service handles exactly one action. This keeps dependencies minimal, tests simple, and maintenance effortless. Perfect for teams aiming for clean, decoupled, and highly testable backend code.
